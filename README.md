#  FriBidiNative
GNU FriBidi native libraries for Windows, Linux and Mac. Recommended for use with [FriBidiSharp](https://github.com/Ghasan/FriBidiSharp/tree/master).

FriBidi binaries are pulled from the [Anaconda package](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/fribidi/files).

Note that the version of the package is the same as the version of FriBidi that it contains.
